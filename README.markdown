# Testing WPF applications using WiPFlash and Cucumber 

Using Cucumber for acceptance testing web applications has been common place over the past year. 

Like Web Applications, desktop based applications also need to be fully tested. Until now, they have always been left on the waste-side. 

By taking advantage of [WiPFlash](http://code.google.com/p/wipflash/) together with [IronRuby](http://ironruby.net/) you can use Cucumber to create acceptance tests for C# and WPF desktop applications.

This is an example of how to get started.
